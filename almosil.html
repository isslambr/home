        <p>
          Hello, my name is Mohamed. In 2020, I experienced a terrifying and mysterious story, which I will share with you.

One day, my father and mother went to the nearby market, leaving me with my little brother Omar. My brother and I were playing together, and then I picked up my phone and started browsing Facebook. I came across a post that said there was a dangerous criminal in our area. This criminal disguised himself as a delivery man, went to houses, knocked on doors pretending to deliver orders, and then attacked the homeowner.

I didn’t pay much attention to the post, but after a while, my brother and I felt hungry. So, I opened a food delivery app and ordered pizza for us. We placed the order and started waiting for the delivery.

Half an hour later, we heard a faint knock on the door. I opened the door to find a man dressed as a delivery person, just like in the post I saw on Facebook. But instead of handing me the pizza, the man began speaking in a strange way. He said he came to ask for some personal information about the family, such as their names and phone numbers.

My heart hesitated, and I felt uneasy about his strange request. I tried to appear calm and told him that we don’t share personal information with strangers. But the man insisted and became more aggressive, which made me feel very scared.

I quickly closed the door and went back to the living room, where my little brother was wondering why I took so long. I tried to calm myself down and explained to him that we wouldn’t be ordering food today, and that we would call our parents to bring us something to eat.

A few minutes later, we heard knocking on the door again, this time more forceful. I made sure not to open the door for anyone without verifying their identity. I used my phone to call our parents, but there was no answer. Anxiety began to take over, and I felt scared that something unusual was happening.

Suddenly, we heard the sound of the door being forced open, and the criminal stormed into the house violently. I looked at my little brother, panic-stricken. The man approached my brother quickly, and suddenly, I saw him stab my little brother with a sharp knife. My brother screamed in pain and fell to the ground, while the man fled the house immediately.

I rushed to my brother, overwhelmed with chaos and tears streaming down my face. My brother was bleeding, but fortunately, the stab wound was not fatal, and he suffered injuries that could be treated. I quickly called the police and an ambulance and managed to provide first aid to my brother until help arrived.

When the police and ambulance arrived, they began their investigation and provided the necessary care for my brother. However, that night was filled with terror and fear, and we didn’t know if the criminal would return. Our family began living in a state of constant tension and worry.

This incident left a deep impact on us, and we started living with extreme caution, making safety and security a top priority. Each of us carried these painful memories, which always remind us that danger can be close, even in seemingly ordinary times.
