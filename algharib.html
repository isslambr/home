        <h1>al gharib story - قصة الغريب</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is... Well, let’s just say my name doesn’t matter right now. What I’m about to tell you isn’t just a simple story; it’s a part of my life, a piece of my past that still lingers and affects me to this day. It’s a story that might change how you see the world, the people around you, and perhaps even yourself.

          One day, my mom and dad left to visit my grandmother, or at least that’s what they always said. It wasn’t unusual for them to leave me home alone occasionally. I didn’t fear being alone—I had gotten used to it. I was sitting on the couch, scrolling mindlessly through my phone, when I suddenly heard a knock at the door. 
          
          It was unexpected. Who could be knocking at this hour? I hesitated but eventually walked to the door and opened it slowly. Standing there was a man who looked like a homeless wanderer, his clothes tattered and his face worn. He asked for a glass of water in a faint, weary voice. His eyes carried a deep sadness and exhaustion, and I felt a pang of pity. I left the door ajar and went to the kitchen to fetch some water. But when I returned, he was gone. 
          
          Where did he go? I paused at the doorway, puzzled. Had he left already? I closed the door and tried to shake off the strange encounter. Feeling a bit uneasy, I decided to head to my room and get some rest. 
          
          But later that night, strange noises woke me. It sounded like faint movements, coming from under my bed. At first, I tried to ignore it, thinking it was just my imagination, but the sounds persisted. It felt as if something—or someone—was moving ever so slowly beneath me. Fear crept in, freezing me in place. 
          
          After what felt like an eternity, I mustered the courage to investigate. I slid off the bed cautiously and leaned down to peer underneath. What I saw made my blood run cold. It was the same homeless man from earlier, lying there with a small bottle containing some kind of strange liquid. 
          
          Before I could scream or react, he sprayed the liquid into my face. The scent was overpowering, and I felt consciousness slipping away. The world around me faded quickly into darkness. 
          
          When I awoke, what seemed like a day later, I found myself tied to a chair with strong ropes, my mouth sealed with duct tape. My head throbbed, and confusion engulfed me. As my vision cleared, I saw the man standing in front of a small table, meticulously arranging a set of sharp tools. It looked like a scene straight out of a nightmare. 
          
          I tried to scream, but the tape muffled any sound. The man turned to me with a cryptic smile and said, "Ah, you’re finally awake, my daughter." 
          
          His words shocked me to my core. Daughter? What was he talking about? 
          
          "Look around you," he said calmly, gesturing to my sides. 
          
          I slowly turned my head, and the sight nearly broke me. To my right and left were my parents—or who I thought were my parents—bound and gagged just like me. Tears streamed down their faces as they tried to speak through the tape. My heart raced with fear and confusion. 
          
          The man approached me and ripped the tape from my mouth. Before I could ask any questions, he said, “I’m your real father. Those people—" he gestured toward my parents, "—are not who you think they are. They kidnapped you.” 
          
          My mind reeled. How could this be true? I looked at the two people who raised me, their eyes filled with panic and pleading. Could they really be kidnappers? 
          
          I stammered, "What are you saying? This doesn’t make any sense! If you’re my real father, then where’s my real mother?" 
          
          His expression darkened, and I saw a deep pain surface in his eyes. "Your mother is gone," he said, his voice heavy with sorrow. "She died because of them. After they took you from us, she couldn’t bear the loss. She cried day and night, refusing to eat or drink, until her body gave up. They destroyed her... and they took you away from me." 
          
          The weight of his words crushed me. "Why didn’t you find me? Why didn’t anyone tell me the truth?" 
          
          "I searched for you for years," he replied. "I never stopped. But they covered their tracks well. They changed your identity and disappeared. I was a police officer, and my job eventually led me to uncover their crimes. They’ve been involved in child abductions for years. When I realized one of those children was you, I knew I had to act." 
          
          My head spun with disbelief and fear. Could it be true? Had my entire life been a lie? And if so, what would happen next? The man, claiming to be my father, stood before me—a stranger with answers I wasn’t ready to hear.</p>
